# How to practice

1. Use an editor that allows to see the preview of Markdown render. Open the `.md` files and the preview window side by side. When look at instruction look at the preview window and when practicing use the .md file to try out. 
2. If you see `↓`, you are supposed to put the cursor there for practice. 
If there is no `↓` at the practice code block, you can put the cursor anywhere.
